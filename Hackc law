⚖️ Hacking Law (Important)

Using hacking tools the wrong way can be illegal.
Under laws like the Indian IT Act 2000 (and similar laws in many countries), unauthorized access, testing, or attacks on systems you don’t own can lead to fines or even jail.

These tools should only be used:

For learning and educational purposes

On your own devices, or

With clear permission (authorized penetration testing)


Testing or attacking someone else’s website, network, or device without permission is strictly illegal.
